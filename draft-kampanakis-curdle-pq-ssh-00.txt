 Post-quantum public key algorithms for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol
                     draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh

Abstract

   This document defines hybrid key exchange methods based on classical
   ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes.  These
   methods are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol.  It
   also defines post-quantum public key authentication methods based on
   post-quantum signature schemes.  These methods are defined for use in
   the SSH Authentication Protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] performs key establishment using key
   exchange methods based exclusively on Diffie-Hellman style schemes.
   SSH [RFC4252] also defines public key authentication methods based on
   RSA or ECDSA/EdDSA signatures schemes.  The cryptographic security of
   these key exchange and signature schemes rely on certain instances of
   the discrete logarithm and integer factorization problem being
   computationally infeasable to solve for adversaries.

   However, when sufficiently large quantum computers becomes available
   these instances would no longer be computationally infeasable
   rendering the current key exchange methods in SSH insecure.  While
   large quantum computers are not available today an adversary can
   record the encrypted communication sent between the client and server
   in an SSH session and then later decrypt the communication when
   sufficiently large quantum computers become available.  This kind of

   attack is known as a "record-and-harvest" attack.  "Record-and-
   harvest" attacks do not apply retroactively to authentication but a
   quantum computer could threaten SSH authentication by impersonating
   as a legitimate client or server.

   This document proposes to solve the problem by extending the SSH
   Transport Layer Protocol [RFC4253] with hybrid key exchange methods
   and the SSH Authentication Protocol [RFC4252] with public key methods
   based on post-quantum signature schemes.  A hybrid key exchange
   method maintains the same level of security provided by current key
   exchange methods, but also adds quantum resistantance.  The security
   provided by the individual key exchange scheme in a hybrid key
   exchange method is independent.  This means that the hybrid key
   exchange method will always be at least as secure as the most secure
   key exchange scheme executed as part of the hybrid key exchange
   method.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   RFC5226 Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.
