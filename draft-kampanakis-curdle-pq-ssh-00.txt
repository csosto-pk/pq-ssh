 Post-quantum public key algorithms for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol
                     draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh

Abstract

   This document defines hybrid key exchange methods based on classical
   ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes.  These
   methods are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol.  It
   also defines post-quantum public key authentication methods based on
   post-quantum signature schemes.  These methods are defined for use in
   the SSH Authentication Protocol.

   EDNOTE: The goal of this draft is to start the standardization of PQ
   algorithms in SSH early to mitigate the potential record-and-harvest
   later with a quantum computer attacks.  This draft is not expected to
   be standardized before the NIST PQ Project has standardized PQ
   algorithms.  After NIST has standardized then this docuement will
   replace TBD1, TBD2, TBD3 with the appropriate algorithms parameters
   before proceeding to standardization.

Internet-Draft                   PQ SSH                      August 2020


1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] performs key establishment using key
   exchange methods based exclusively on (Elliptic Curve) Diffie-Hellman
   style schemes.  SSH [RFC4252], [RFC8332], [RFC5656], [RFC8709] also
   define public key authentication methods based on RSA or ECDSA/EdDSA
   signatures schemes.  The cryptographic security of these key exchange
   and signature schemes relies on certain instances of the discrete
   logarithm and integer factorization problem being computationally
   infeasable to solve for adversaries.

   However, when sufficiently large quantum computers becomes available
   these instances would no longer be computationally infeasable
   rendering the current key exchange and authentication methods in SSH
   insecure.  While large quantum computers are not available today an
   adversary can record the encrypted communication sent between the
   client and server in an SSH session and then later decrypt the
   communication when sufficiently large quantum computers become
   available.  This kind of attack is known as a "record-and-harvest"
   attack.  "Record-and-harvest" attacks do not apply retroactively to
   authentication but a quantum computer could threaten SSH
   authentication by impersonating as a legitimate client or server.

   This document proposes to address the problem by extending the SSH
   Transport Layer Protocol [RFC4253] with hybrid key exchange methods
   and the SSH Authentication Protocol [RFC4252] with public key methods
   based on post-quantum signature schemes.  A hybrid key exchange
   method maintains the same level of security provided by current key
   exchange methods, but also adds quantum resistantance.  The security
   provided by the individual key exchange scheme in a hybrid key
   exchange method is independent.  This means that the hybrid key
   exchange method will always be at least as secure as the most secure
   key exchange scheme executed as part of the hybrid key exchange
   method.

   In the context of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization
   Project, key exchange algorithms are formulated as key encapsulation
   mechanisms (KEMs), which consist of three algorithms:

   *  'KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)': A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key 'pk' and a secret key 'sk'.

   *  'Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss)': A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key 'pk' and outputs a ciphertext
      'ct' and shared secret 'ss'.

Internet-Draft                   PQ SSH                      August 2020


   *  'Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss': A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key 'sk' and ciphertext 'ct' and outputs a shared
      secret 'ss', or in some cases a distinguished error value.

   The main security property for KEMs is indistinguishability under
   adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2), which means that shared
   secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings even
   given the ability to have arbitrary ciphertexts decapsulated.  IND-
   CCA2 corresponds to security against an active attacker, and the
   public key / secret key pair can be treated as a long-term key or
   reused.  A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under
   chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret
   values should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy
   of the public key.  IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a
   passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.

   The post-quantum KEMs used for hybrid key exchange in the document
   are TBD1, TBD2.  The post-quantum signauture algorithm used for key
   based authentication is TBD3.  [EDNOTE: Placeholdrer.  Algorithms
   will be identified after NIST Round 3 concludes.]  The post-quantunt
   algorithms are defined in NIST Post-quantum Project
   [pq_nist].[EDNOTE: Update link.  Algorithms can change based on
   NIST's Round 3 standardization].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Hybrid Key Exchange

2.1.  Hybrid Key Exchange Method Abstraction

   This section defines the abstract structure of a hybrid key exchange
   method.  The structure must be instantiated with two key exchange
   schemes.  Given key exchange schemes X and Y, the X+Y hybrid key
   exchange method is implemented using the following exchange messages
   below.  The byte, string and mpint are to be intepreted in this
   document as described in [RFC4251].

   The client sends

       byte SSH_MSG_HBR_X_Y_INIT
       string C_CL
       string C_PQ

   The server sends

Internet-Draft                   PQ SSH                      August 2020


       byte SSH_MSG_HBR_X_Y_REPLY
       string S_CL
       string S_PQ

   C_PQ represents the client post-quantum publoc key.  S_CL represents
   the ciphertext which encapsulates a shared secret randomly generated
   by the server to the client's public key.  The client wll decapsulate
   it using its private key.

   The string name of the key exchange schemes X and Y will replace the
   X and Y in the message names 'SSH_MSG_HBR_X_Y_INIT' and
   'SSH_MSG_HBR_X_Y_REPLY' in specific instantiations found in
   Section [EDNOTE: Update Section number.].


2.2.  Key Derivation

   Derivation of encryption keys MUST be done according to Section 7.2
   in [RFC4253] with the following modifications.  The shared secrets
   K_CL and K_PQ are the output from the two key exchange schemes X and
   Y, respectively, that instantiates an abstract hybrid key exchange
   method Section 2.  The SSH shared secret K defined as

                   K = PRF(K_PQ, K_CL) [EDNOTE: Define PRF]

   K MUST be encoded as an mpint and the resulting bytes are fed as
   described [RFC4253] to the key exchange method's hash function to
   generate encryption keys.

2.3.  HASH

   A named hybrid key exchange name includes a named hash.  The exchange
   hash H is the result of computing the HASH, where HASH is the hash
   algorithm specified in the named hybrid key exchange method name,
   over the concatenation of the following

         string V_C, client identification string (CR and LF excluded)
         string V_S, server identification string (CR and LF excluded)
         string I_C, payload of the client's SSH_MSG_KEXINIT
         string I_S, payload of the server's SSH_MSG_KEXINIT
         string C_CL, X client message octet string
         string C_PQ, Y client message octet string
         string S_CL, X server message octet string
         string S_PQ, Y server message octet string
         mpint K, SSH shared secret

   The HASH functions used for the definitions in this specification are
   SHA-256 [nist-sha2] [RFC4634].

2.4.  Hybrid Key Exchange Method Names

   The hybrid key exchange method names defined in this document are

         ecdh-nistp256-TBD1-sha256
         x25519-TBD1-sha256

   [EDNOTE: Placeholdrer.  Algorithms will be identified after NIST
   Round 3 concludes.]

2.4.1.  ecdh-nistp256-TBD1-sha256

   ecdh-nistp256-TBD1-sha256 defines that the classical C_CL or S_CL
   from the client or server NIST P-256 curve public key as defined in
   [nist-sp800-186].  Private and public keys are generated as described
   therein.  Public keys are defined as strings of 32 bytes for NIST
   P-256.  The K_CL shared secret is generated from the exchanged C_CL
   and S_CL public keys as defined in [RFC5656] (key agrement method
   ecdh-sha2-nistp256) with SHA-256 [nist-sha2] [RFC4634] instead of
   SHA-256 as the hash.

   The post-quantum C_PQ or S_PQ string from the client and server are
   TBD1.  The K_PQ shared secret is decapsulated from the ciphertext
   S_PQ using the client private key [EDNOTE: Placeholdrer.  Update
   based on the algorithm identified after NIST Round 3 concludes.]

2.4.2.  x25519-TBD1-sha256

   x25519-TBD1-sha256 defines that the classical C_CL or S_CL from the
   client or server is Curve25519 public key as defined in [RFC7748].
   Private and public keys are generated as described therein.  Public
   keys are defined as strings of 32 bytes for Curve25519.  The K_CL
   shared secret is generated from the exchanged C_CL and S_CL public
   keys as defined in [RFC8731] (key agrement method curve25519-sha256)
   with SHA-256 [nist-sha2] [RFC4634] instead of SHA-256 as the hash.

   The post-quantum C_PQ or S_PQ string from the client and server are
   TBD1.  The K_PQ shared secret is decapsulated from the ciphertext
   S_PQ using the client private key as defined in [EDNOTE:
   Placeholdrer.  Update based on the algorithm identified after NIST
   Round 3 concludes.]

3.  Key Authentication

   [EDNOTE: Discuss is hybrid auth keys which combine classical and PQ
   signatures are necessary.  Since authentication cannot be broken
   retroactively, even if the PQ signature algorithms got broken, we
   could switch to a classical algorithm to at least keep the classical
   security.  On the other hand, that would take time to deploy while
   these entities would be vulnerabile to impersonation attacks.  Hybrid
   signatures add some overhead, but could provide the peace of mind of
   remaining secure with the classical algorithm without scrambling to
   deploy a change even if the PQ algorithms got broken. ]

3.1.  Public Key Format

         string    "ssh-TBD3"
         string    key

   Here, 'key' is the x-octet public key described in the TBD3
   specification.

   [EDNOTE: Placeholdrer.  Algorithms will be identified after NIST
   Round 3 concludes.]

3.2.  Signature Format

          string  "ssh-TBD3"
          string  signature

   Here, 'signature' is the x-octet signature produced in accordance
   with the TBD3 specification.

   [EDNOTE: Placeholdrer.  Algorithms will be identified after NIST
   Round 3 concludes.]

3.3.  Signing and Verification

   Signatures are generated according to the procedure in TBD3
   specification

   Signatures are verified according to the procedure in TBD3
   specification

   [EDNOTE: Placeholdrer.  Algorithms will be identified after NIST
   Round 3 concludes.]

4.  Message Size

   An implementaton adhering to [RFC4253] must be able to support
   packets with an uncompressed payload length of 32768 bytes or less
   and a total packet size of 35000 bytes or less (including
   'packet_length', 'padding_length', 'payload', 'random padding', and
   'mac').  These numbers represent what must be 'minimally supported'
   by implementations.  This can present a problem when using post-
   quantum key exchange schemes because some post-quantum schemes can
   produce much larger messages than what is normally produced by
   existing key exchange methods defined for SSH.  This document does
   not define any named domain parameters (see Section 7) that cause any
   hybrid key exchange method related packets to exceed the minimally
   supported packet length.  This document does not define behaviour in
   cases where a hybrid key exchange message cause a packet to exceed
   the minimally supported packet length.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes requests of IANA for SSH_MSG_HBR_X_Y_INIT,

   ssh-TBD3

7.  Security Considerations

   [EDNOTE: The security considerations given in [RFC5656] therefore
   also applies to the ECDH key exchange scheme defined in this
   document.  Similarly for the X25519 document.  PQ Algorithms are
   newer and standardized by NIST.  And more.  ]
