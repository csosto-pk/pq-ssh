      <name>Introduction</name>
		
      <t>Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC4251" format="default"/> performs key establishment using key exchange methods based on (Elliptic Curve) Diffie-Hellman style schemes defined in <xref target="RFC5656" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8731" format="default"/>. <!-- SSH <xref target="RFC4252" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC8332" format="default"/>  <xref target="RFC8709" format="default"/> also defines public key authentication methods based on RSA, ECDSA, or EdDSA signature schemes.--> The cryptographic security of these key exchanges <!-- and signature schemes-->relies on certain instances of the discrete logarithm <!-- and integer factorization --> problem being computationally infeasible to solve for adversaries. </t>
	  <t>However, if sufficiently large quantum computers become available, these instances would no longer be computationally infeasible rendering the current key exchange and authentication methods in SSH insecure <xref target="I-D.hoffman-c2pq"/>. While large quantum computers are not available today an adversary could record the encrypted communication sent between the client and server in an SSH session and later decrypt it when sufficiently large quantum computers become available. This kind of attack is  known as a "harvest-now-decrypt-later" attack. <!--Record-and-harvest attacks do not apply retroactively to authentication but a quantum computer could threaten SSH authentication by impersonating as a legitimate client or server. --></t>
	  
	  <t>This document addresses the problem by extending the SSH Transport Layer Protocol <xref target="RFC4253" format="default"/> key exchange with Post-Quantum Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid <xref target="I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology"/> key exchange methods. <!--and the SSH Authentication Protocol <xref target="RFC4252" format="default"/> with public key methods based on post-quantum signature schemes--><!--TODO: Update to hybrid if we end up doing hybrid. --> The security provided by each individual key exchange scheme in a PQ/T Hybrid key exchange method is independent. This means that the PQ/T Hybrid key exchange method will always be at least as secure as the most secure key exchange scheme executed as part of the exchange. <xref target="PQ-PROOF" format="default"/> <xref target="PQ-PROOF2" format="default"/> contain proofs of security for such PQ/T Hybrid key exchange schemes.</t>
	  
      <t>In the context of the <xref target="NIST_PQ" format="default"/>, key exchange algorithms are formulated as key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), which consist of three algorithms:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>'KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)': A probabilistic key generation algorithm, which generates a public key 'pk' and a secret key 'sk'.</li>
        <li>'Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss)': A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm, which takes as input a public key 'pk' and outputs a ciphertext 'ct' and shared secret 'ss'. </li>
        <li>'Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss': A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as input a secret key 'sk' and ciphertext 'ct' and outputs a shared secret 'ss', or in some cases a distinguished error value.</li>
      </ul>
	  	 
      <t>The main security property for KEMs is indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2), which means that shared secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings even given the ability to have arbitrary ciphertexts decapsulated.  IND-CCA2 corresponds to security against an active attacker, and the public key / secret key pair can be treated as a long-term key or reused.  <!-- A common design pattern for obtaining security under key reuse is to apply the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform <xref target="FO" format="default"/> or a variant thereof <xref target="HHK" format="default"/>. --> A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the public key. IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.</t>
	  
	  <!-- <t>The corresponding post-quantum signature algorithms defined in the <xref target="NIST_PQ" format="default">NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project</xref> are </t>
      <ul>
        <li>'KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)': A probabilistic key generation algorithm, which generates a public key 'pk' and a secret key 'sk'.</li>
        <li>'Sign(m, sk) -> sig': A deterministic signing algorithm, which takes as input a message 'm' and a private key 'sk' and outputs a signature 'sig'. </li>
        <li>'Verify(m, pk, sigma) -> pass/fail': A verification algorithm, which takes as input a message 'm', a public key 'pk' and a signature 'sig' and outputs a verification pass or failure of the signature on the message.</li>
      </ul> --> 
	 
	  <t>The post-quantum KEM used in the document is ML-KEM. ML-KEM was standardized in 2024 <xref target="FIPS203"/> with three parameter variants, ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024. This specification's PQ/T Hybrid key exchange message abstraction, key derivation, and input to the SSH hash calculation, H, align with the ones defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sshm-ntruprime-ssh" format="default"/> which uses a different quantum-resistant KEM.</t>

    	<t>This section defines the abstract structure of a PQ/T Hybrid key exchange method. This  structure must be instantiated with two key exchange schemes. The byte and string types are to be interpreted in this document as described in <xref target="RFC4251" format="default"/>.</t>

        <t>In a PQ/T Hybrid key exchange, instead of SSH_MSG_KEXDH_INIT <xref target="RFC4253" format="default"/> or SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT <xref target="RFC5656" format="default"/>, the client sends</t>
<artwork align="left" name="" type="" alt=""><![CDATA[
       byte     SSH_MSG_KEX_HYBRID_INIT
       string   C_INIT
]]></artwork>

        <t>where C_INIT is the concatenation of C_PK2 and C_PK1 (C_INIT = C_PK2 || C_PK1, where || depicts concatenation). C_PK1 and C_PK2 represent the ephemeral client public keys used for each key exchange of the PQ/T Hybrid mechanism. Typically, C_PK1 represents a traditional / classical (i.e., ECDH) key exchange public key. C_PK2 represents the 'pk' output of the corresponding post-quantum KEM's 'KeyGen' at the client. </t>
		
        <t>Instead of SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY <xref target="RFC4253" format="default"/> or SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY <xref target="RFC5656" format="default"/>, the server sends</t>
<artwork align="left" name="" type="" alt=""><![CDATA[
       byte     SSH_MSG_KEX_HYBRID_REPLY
       string   K_S, server's public host key
       string   S_REPLY
       string   the signature on the exchange hash
]]></artwork>
        <t>where S_REPLY is the concatenation of S_CT2 and S_PK1 (S_REPLY = S_CT2 || S_PK1). Typically, S_PK1 represents the ephemeral (EC)DH server public key. S_CT2 represents the ciphertext 'ct' output of the corresponding KEM's 'Encaps' algorithm generated by the server which encapsulates a secret to the client public key C_PK2. Before producing S_CT2, the server MUST perform the encapsulation key checks defined in Section 7.2 of <xref target="FIPS203"/>, and abort using a disconnect message (SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT) with a SSH_DISCONNECT_KEY_EXCHANGE_FAILED as the reason, if they fail. <!--The client decapsulates the ciphertext by using its private key which leads to K_PQ, a post-quantum shared secret for SSH.--></t>

        <!-- <t>[EDNOTE: Initially we were encoding the client and server traditional and post-quantum public key/ciphertext as its own string. We since switched to an encoding method which concatenates them together as a single string in the C_INIT, S_REPLY message. This method concatenates the raw values rather than the length of each value plus the value. The total length of the concatenation is still known, but the relative lengths of the individual values that were concatenated is no longer part of the representation. This assumes that the lengths of individual values are fixed once the algorithm is selected, which is the case for traditional key exchange methods currently supported by SSH and all post-quantum KEMs in Round 3 of the NIST post-quantum standardization project. If that is the WG consensus we need to put a note of this in the Appendix for historical reference and expand on the concatenated string here in this section. For example, the C_CL is represented as a fixed length 32 byte string for Curve25519. ] </t> --> 
        
        <t>C_PK1, S_PK1, C_PK2, S_CT2 are used to establish two shared secrets, K_CL and K_PQ. K_CL is the output from the classical ECDH exchange using C_PK1 and S_PK1. K_PQ is the post-quantum shared secret decapsulated from S_CT2. Before decapsulating, the client MUST check if the ciphertext S_CT2 length matches the selected ML-KEM variant. The client MUST abort using a disconnect message (SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT) with a SSH_DISCONNECT_KEY_EXCHANGE_FAILED as the reason if the S_CT2 length does not match the ML-KEM variant or decapsulation fails for any other reason. K_CL and K_PQ are used together to generate the shared secret K according to Section 2.4. </t>
	<t>For all method names, both the client and server MUST process the ECDH and X25519 public keys (C_PK1, S_PK1) as described in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5656" format="default"/> and Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8731" format="default"/> respectively, including validity and length checks and SSH disconnect messages if the checks fail.</t>

	<t>An implementation adhering to <xref target="RFC4253" format="default"/> must be able to support packets with an uncompressed payload length of 32768 bytes or less and a total packet size of 35000 bytes or less (including 'packet_length', 'padding_length', 'payload', 'random padding', and 'mac'). These numbers represent what must be 'minimally supported' by implementations. This can present a problem when using post-quantum key exchange schemes because some post-quantum schemes can produce much larger messages than what is normally produced by existing key exchange methods defined for SSH. This document does not define any method names (<xref target="kex-methods" format="default"/>) that cause any PQ/T Hybrid key exchange method related packets to exceed the minimally supported packet length. This document does not define behavior in cases where a PQ/T Hybrid key exchange message cause a packet to exceed the minimally supported packet length.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
	  <t>The security considerations given in <xref target="RFC5656" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8731" format="default"/> also apply to the ECDH part of the P/T Hybrid key exchange schemes defined in this document.</t>
	  <t>The way a derived binary secret string is encoded (i.e., adding or removing zero bytes for encoding) before it is hashed may lead to a variable-length secret which raises the potential for a side-channel attack. In broad terms, when the secret is longer, the hash function may need to process more blocks internally which could determine the length of what is hashed. This could leak the most significant bit of the derived secret and/or allow detection of when the most significant bytes are zero. In some unfortunate circumstances, this has led to timing attacks, e.g. the Lucky Thirteen <xref target="LUCKY13" format="default"/> and Raccoon <xref target="RACCOON" format="default"/> attacks. In <xref target="RFC8731" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC5656" format="default"/>, the ECDH shared secrets were mpint and fixed-length integer encoded respectively which raised a potential for such side-channel attacks. This problem is addressed in this document by encoding K_PQ and K_CL as fixed-length byte arrays and K as a string. Implementations MUST use these encodings for K_PQ, K_CL, and K.</t>
      <t><xref target="NIST-SP-800-56C" format="default"/> and <xref target="NIST-SP-800-135" format="default"/> gives NIST recommendations for key derivation methods in key exchange protocols. Some PQ/T Hybrid combinations may combine the shared secret from a NIST-approved algorithm (e.g., ECDH using the nistp256/secp256r1 curve or ML-KEM) with a shared secret from a non-approved algorithm (e.g., X25519). <xref target="NIST-SP-800-56C" format="default"/> lists simple concatenation as an approved method for generation of a PQ/T Hybrid shared secret in which one of the constituent shared secret is from an approved method. Thus, the combination of the two shared secrets in this document is FIPS-approved assuming the ECDH curve and ML-KEM negotiated parameters are FIPS approved. <xref target="NIST-SP-800-135"/> also approves the key derivation used in SSH. This method is the same used in this document to derive keys from the quantum-resistant shared secret for use in SSH. Thus, the keys derived from the PQ/T Hybrid key exchange in this document are FIPS approved.</t>
	  <t><xref target="PQ-PROOF" format="default"/> <xref target="PQ-PROOF2" format="default"/> contain proofs of security for PQ/T Hybrid key exchange schemes. <xref target="PQ-PROOF2" format="default"/> discusses how the key combination to derive K and the derivation of SSH symmetric keys in this document can be proven IND-CPA and IND-CCA2 secure with some assumptions. IND-CPA is achieved if we assume the HASH calls perform as a KDF which is a reasonable assumption. IND-CCA2 security is achieved by assuming the HASH is a random oracle which is a stronger assumption especially for hash functions like SHA-2 which permit length extension concerns. To leverage a HASH which is more suitable as a random oracle, we could use SHAKE256 or introduce HMAC-SHA-256 as proposed in options (2b) and (2c) in <xref target="appendix"/>. This document uses SHA2 which is ubiquitous although it makes an IND-CCA2 proof need stronger assumptions because even SSH's traditional key derivation has not been proven to be IND-CCA2. <!-- EDNOTE: Even if the K combiner was IND-CCA2 (i.e. if we used connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem or josefsson-chempat combiner, the rest of the key derivation would not be. --> As with (EC)DH keys today, generating an ephemeral key exchange keypair for ECDH and ML-KEM is still REQUIRED per connection by this specification (IND-CPA security). Implementations also MUST NOT reuse randomness in the generation of KEM ciphertexts.</t>

          <t> This document specify Chempat as a generic family of instantiated Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Key Exchange Methods (KEMs). The goal is to provide a generic combiner construct that can be analysed separately for security assurance, and to offer concrete instantiated algorithms for integration into protocol and implementations. Identified instances are provided based on traditional Diffie-Hellman key agreement using curves P-256, P-384, X25519, X448, brainpoolP256, brainpoolP384 combined with post quantum methods ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024, Streamlined NTRU Prime sntrup761, and Classic McEliece. </t>

	  <t>Other combiners to derive K and the SSH keys were considered while working on this document. These include</t>
        <ol type="(%d)">
		  <li>K = K_PQ || K_CL. All SSH keys are derived from K as defined in Section 7.2 in <xref target="RFC4253" format="default"/>.</li>
		  <li><t>All SSH keys are derived from K as defined in Section 7.2 in <xref target="RFC4253" format="default"/>. </t>
		     <ol type="(%c)">
			   <li>K = HASH(K_PQ, K_CL). This is the option adopted in this specification.</li>
			   <li>K = HMAC-HASH(K_PQ, K_CL)</li>
			   <li>K = HMAC-HASH(0, K_PQ || K_CL)</li>
			 </ol>
		  </li>
		  <li>K = HKDF-HASH_Extract(0, K_PQ || K_CL). SSH keys are now derived from K using HKDF-HASH(K, H || session_id, 6*sizeof(HASH)).</li>
		</ol>

	  <t>Option (3) follows the Extract-and-Expand logic described in <xref target="NIST-SP-800-56C" format="default"/>. It deviates from existing SSH key derivation significantly and might be viewed as too far from the current SSH design. It probably would be a good approach for SSH to move from basic hashing everywhere to use proper KDFs with extract/expand, but that should be a separate effort.</t>	
	  
	  <t>We also considered combiners like the ones proposed in <xref target="I-D.josefsson-chempat" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem" format="default"/>. <xref target="I-D.connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem" format="default"/> has a separate IND-CCA2 security proof. Although such combiners may be proven IND-CCA2 secure, to be IND-CCA2, the SSH key derivation would still require the assumptions laid out in <xref target="PQ-PROOF2" format="default"/> and discussed in <xref target="Security" format="default"/>.</t>
